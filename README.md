# PyStellarEngine
This is a library that is built on top of Pygame. It aims to be both easy to use and powerful, with fully blown object oriented programming. It is currently being developed by LeapBeforeYouLook (William Gardner) and Ramaraunt (Daniel Valcour).You are free to use this library for your own projects, commercial or personal, as long as you include the LISENCE.md file with your creation.

It works like this:

First, you instantiate a game object, which handles everything deep down. Then, you instantiate room objects, which act as containers for different levels/menus of your game. In each room, you then add objects, and code those objects to do what you want every frame. Attached to objects, you can add things like sprites, rigidbodies, pathfinders, hitboxes, and many more things which we are working on.
